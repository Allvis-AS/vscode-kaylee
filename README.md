# VS Code extension for the Kaylee modelling language

This extension is a toy/proof-of-concept project for a
modelling language I'm working on.

It aids in modelling entity relationships in such a way
that a code generator may generate appropriate
representations in your language of choice.

*Code generators are not included here, this is purely a syntax highlighting extension.*
